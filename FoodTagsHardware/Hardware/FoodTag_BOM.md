## Notes
Price could potentially be further reduced if photoresistor not used (down to ~$2.97369), and microcontroller exchanged for a cheaper one with the same low power properties. May also be of interest to look into digital sensors, however all that fit the ultra low power nature of the project were out of stock at the time.

This version of the tag does require through-hole components (mainly the 1000µF capacitors and the photoresistor).

The Antenna could also be etched onto the PCB directly instead of purchased as a separate component.
