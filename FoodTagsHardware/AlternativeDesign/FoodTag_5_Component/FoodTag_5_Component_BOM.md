## Pros

- Very low cost (reciever + transmitter combo could potentially cost less than our original transmitter
- Proven design on the breadboard
- Very few parts (someone could feasibly make the transmitter by themselves without any specialty parts whatsoever)

## Cons

- Only one "sensor" can be used (either a photoresistor, thermistor, etc)
- Power output is quite unstable, not a clean oscillator (can account for this with reciever having software envelope detection)
- Transmitter and reciever need to be extremely close together to get a useful signal

## Notes
- Prices could potentially be further reduced if antennas are made without powerful inductors (which need to be through hole!), instead maybe a less powerful inductor with a custom antenna design.
- rechargable Li-on Battery and support circuitry could potentially get the final reciever price to much higher than currently estimated, but still extremely cheap in comparison to a smartphone (e.g. ~5$)
