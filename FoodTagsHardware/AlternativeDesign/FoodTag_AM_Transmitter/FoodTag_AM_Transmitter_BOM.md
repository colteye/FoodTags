## Thermistor
- ERT-J0ER103J thermistor $0.03546 @ qty 1000

## Overall BOM (NOT INCLUDING BOARD, MANUFACTURING, AND ANTENNA):
$0.46789 @ qty 1000

## Pros
- Very low cost
- Theoretically should work with any AM reciever that can successfully output around 4.8 mA to the transmitter, and tune to 15.6 MHz
- Uses only basic components such as diodes, transistors, resistors, and capacitors

## Cons
- Slight DC offset to the signals
- Not fully verified on a circuit board, unable to properly test that oscillator can go fully to 15.6 MHz
- Only one sensor at a time
- No reciever has been tested

## Notes
Price could potentially be further reduced if input of energy harvesting is already an AC carrier signal, maybe remove oscillator?
